## Accessibility

Backplates are bound to content and ergonomic requirements. They determine the readability of UI elements.

In passthrough or mixed reality, the control over readability is constantly challenged by the colors and brightness of the reality. Modus's backplates have been tested in multiple conditions, but we continue encouraging testing themes and tweak the values if absolutely necessary, to serve users' needs in their working environments.
