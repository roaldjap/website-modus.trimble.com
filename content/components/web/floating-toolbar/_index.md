## Overview

A floating toolbar is a row or column of on-screen [Buttons](/components/web/buttons/) (icon buttons) used to activate controls in an application. It can be a row/column of single icon buttons or a series of icon buttons combined together. Floating toolbars are fixed in one position on the screen. - Typically, a floating toolbar is placed on either (left or right) side or on the top or bottom of the application window.
