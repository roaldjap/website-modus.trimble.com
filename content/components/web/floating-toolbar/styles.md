## Specifications

- A floating toolbar consists of icon buttons which are placed on screen separately (single icon buttons) or on an own mini-frame (combined icon buttons). It offers a way to eliminate any unused space of a toolbar and limit its size to the necessary controls.
- Using secondary icon-only buttons in default size (32px) is recommended, see [Buttons](/components/web/buttons/).
- To provide a distinction of the floating toolbar and support the floating effect, a level of elevaton (Level 3) is applied. See [Shadows & Depth](/foundations/shadows-and-depth/).
- The icon buttons can be aligned as a row (horizontally) or as a column (vertically).
- Vertically aligned floating toolbars are usually located on the (left or right) side of the screen.
- Horizontally aligned floating toolbars reside at the top or bottom of the application window.

**Floating toolbar consisting of single icon buttons:**

- The padding between the single icon buttons is 4px.

**Floating toolbar consisting of combined icon buttons:**

- Icon buttons which are combined together have only outer corners of the entire toolbar rounded.
- Related control groups can be separated by a divider.
