## Overview

Transactional email is a method of customer communication in which automated, real-time messages are sent to users through email after a specific action has been performed within an application, website, or portal. Sometimes referred to as “triggered emails” or “automated emails,” transactional emails typically contain personalized information that pertains directly to the action taken by the user, or provide system notifications.

One of the main goals of sending transactional emails is to instantaneously connect and communicate valuable information to a single user at key moments of the user’s interaction with the system. For a positive user experience, the most critical piece of sending transactional emails is 100% deliverability.
