## Overview

Chips represent a complex piece of information in a compact form, such as an entity (person, place, or thing) or text. They allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions. Unlike buttons, chips should appear dynamically as a group of multiple interactive elements.

## Usage

#### Use when

- Enabling and verifying user input.
- Using tags or descriptive words to filter content.
- Delineating and displaying options in a compact area. They are a good alternative to toggle buttons or checkboxes.

#### Don't use when

- There is only one option.
