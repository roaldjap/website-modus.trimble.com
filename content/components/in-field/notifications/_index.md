## Overview

A notification displays information that is helpful but not essential. It doesn't interrupt the user's work. A notification is fleeting.

## Usage

#### Use when

- You need to display minor information that is "nice-to-know" but does not require the user to take any action. Examples include the current progress of something the user has initiated or the correct process to follow if a user action was unsuccessful.

#### Don't use when

- The user should attend to the issue but can carry on working for a time until the issue is resolved and/or the UI can sensibly be rendered while the issue is in play. Use a [Prompt](/components/in-field/prompt/) instead.
- There is a system critical action the user must take. If the user should stop work and immediately attend to a problem or error, use an [Alarm](/components/in-field/alarms/).

## Examples

Basic notification with heading text only.

{{<img src="/img/in-field/notifications-example-1.svg" dark="/img/in-field/notifications-example-1-dark.svg" width="1087" alt="Notifications example 1" loading="auto">}}

When more information is required add sub-text.

{{<img src="/img/in-field/notifications-example-2.svg" dark="/img/in-field/notifications-example-2-dark.svg" width="1087" alt="Notifications example 2" loading="auto">}}
