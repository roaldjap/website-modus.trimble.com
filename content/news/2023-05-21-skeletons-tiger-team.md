**Next Tiger Team Starting: Skeletons, Placeholders, and Empty States!**

The Modus world without Tigers would be empty. Correct: e-m-p-t-y! We are searching for contributors to join a Tiger Team for:

- **Skeletons** (placeholders anticipating UI content)
- **Placeholders** (space for appearing content)
- **Empty States** (in-between moments when there is nothing to display).

We had a grand start with this topic on Animations & Microinteractions Tiger Team but we want more! And we know that some of you are eager to get started with these topics.

Fill the gap in the Tiger Team!

[Join the Skeletons, Placeholders, and Empty States Tiger Team by May 31!](https://forms.gle/csv4WwJ7dVueLyTm8)
