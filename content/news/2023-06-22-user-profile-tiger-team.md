**User Profile Menu - Let's Align It**

What's behind the user avatar or profile picture token across Trimble products? Developing aligned patterns would benefit our users. We are searching for more contributors to join a Tiger Team to better consolidate user profile menu patterns. Benchmarking the existing patterns to find synergies is vital in this project.

We have the following objectives for the User Profile Menu Tiger Team:

- Enhancing Trimble product experience.
- Covering admin mode options.
- Considering dot-com experience.

If you are interested in this challenge and want to represent the needs of the products you are working on, please join the Tiger Team!

[Join the User Profile Menu Tiger Team by July 6!](https://forms.gle/ywfzyaGnmiUCmE6JA)
