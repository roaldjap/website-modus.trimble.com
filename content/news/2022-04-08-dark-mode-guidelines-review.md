Dear Trimble UX Community,

Welcome to the Dark Side! The Dark Mode Tiger Team has proposed guidelines for the dark mode (a dark background display settings for user interfaces). It is covering the entire set of current Modus components. Please, review the documentation, specifications, and mockups and submit your feedback by clicking the button at the end of this post latest by **Monday, April 25**.

- [Dark Mode guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gd8KhiDhAdlVxuPlYe8e12FYPP1-AmeiMo7zcI3XlYo/edit?usp=sharing)

- [Adobe XD file](https://xd.adobe.com/view/6e4719f4-2da4-4db6-9bdb-609bccffcf46-3b14/grid/)

When reviewing the documentation, take under consideration the needs of your product as well as other products at Trimble. Some questions you may want to ask yourself during your review:

- Is the dark mode going to work for my product?
- Does my product have a specific need, functionality, or codependency that this proposal does not cover?
- Are there any limitations in my product that might prevent me from successfully implementing dark mode as proposed?
- Anything else you would like us to consider?

Thank you so much for taking the time to review the proposed guidelines for dark mode and providing your feedback! We appreciate your effort and contributions. Once we review the feedback from the community, we will make necessary revisions and dark mode will be implemented to Modus after the final approval by the UX Board.
