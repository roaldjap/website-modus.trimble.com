Hello Trimble UX community!

[Register Now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdP0i8Upl_WQVhX-QUQXeZUW_tTO7SRzYDEC7W54150Dcx1Ng/viewform) for the UX Summit, November 9 - 11!
Virtual & Around the World

If you are familiar with the Trimble Connect & Scale 2025 vision (and we believe you are), you may have wondered how our Trimble product teams are becoming more customer focused: How do we find out what our customers need before they can even ask for it? How can we capture those unmet needs in prototypes that can be validated with customers? How do we create user interfaces that are inviting, consistently branded, easy to learn and use, and allow our users to follow their workflows without even noticing they are accessing different products? How do we fit all this magic into our crammed product development practices and schedules?

In its second UX Summit (this time virtual), the Trimble User Experience community will showcase how we focus on our customers by:

- Employing best practices for user research,
- Using agile methods for integrating design and user validation into the development process; and
- Reporting out on our collaborative experience of building, adopting and growing Modus, our design system platform, which was created as an outcome of our first UX Summit in 2019.

This is a virtual meeting for UX practitioners by UX practitioners and a great opportunity to find out more about our work. We think that the [content](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15EUxUAum0oagsacmaXrMBTLIUdyTJDpQqoPBY6ayri0/edit?usp=sharing) would be interesting to anyone currently working with UX (PM and Dev), or considering embedding a UX Designer in their product work. We would love to have outside participation and look forward to the dialogue!
